# Hyperspectral Camera Project
This repository contains the code, simulation, and resources developed for my final year project:  
**Design and implementation of a low-cost hyperspectral imaging system.**
## Files
- [Calibration Script](hypercubevisualization.py) – spectral calibration and hyperspectral cube construction.  
- [Registration Script](webcamerashift.py) – frame alignment using phase correlation.  
- [Calibration Image](Calibration%20Image.png) – reference spectrum image used for calibration.  
- [Optical Simulation](opticalsimfinalvers.zmx) – Zemax optical model of the hyperspectral camera.  
## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Run the calibration script with the provided calibration image (`Calibration Image.png`).  
3. Run the registration script with two test frames to align them.  
4. Open the `.zmx` file in Zemax to view the optical design and simulation.
